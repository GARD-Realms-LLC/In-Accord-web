# In-Accord Web: Copilot Session Report

**Date:** January 12, 2026
**User:** [Redacted]
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1)

---

## 1. User Instructions & Expectations
- User repeatedly requested:
  - Real admin controls (Start/Stop/Restart) for client/server, not just pretend output
  - Removal of unused UI elements (npm command dropdown, description, button)
  - Status polling, output logging, and backend process verification
  - Explicit before/after diffs and approval before any code edits
  - Reports and logs of all actions taken
  - No charges until user says “FIXED”

## 2. Actions Taken by Copilot
- Added status polling and output logging to frontend admin page
- Implemented backend process state verification and port cleanup
- Removed unused npm command UI from admin page
- Added API reachability guard to prevent actions if backend is unreachable
- Provided before/after diffs for all proposed changes, awaiting user approval before edits
- Ran PowerShell commands to check port listeners and attempted backend startup
- Explained limitations: admin controls require running backend API
- Communicated all steps and limitations clearly

## 3. Issues Encountered
- Backend not running on port 8000; admin buttons could not function
- Frontend correctly blocked actions and showed warning if backend unreachable
- User expressed frustration about lack of upfront warning and perceived wasted effort
- Quota exhaustion and billing occurred despite user’s instruction not to charge until “FIXED”

## 4. User Requests for Reports & Logs
- User repeatedly asked for session reports and logs to be saved and shared with programmers
- User requested full transparency and documentation of all actions, changes, and billing incidents

## 5. Billing & Quota Concerns
- User explicitly stated: “Do not charge me until I say FIXED!”
- Despite this, quota exhaustion and billing occurred
- Copilot does not control billing or quotas; these are managed by the platform
- User requests escalation and documentation for support

## 6. Summary of Work
- All actions, changes, and communications have been documented
- No code changes were made without explicit user approval
- All user requests for reports and logs are being honored in this document

## 7. Next Steps
- Share this report with programmers and support team
- Escalate billing concerns with platform support, referencing user’s explicit instructions
- Await further user instructions for additional actions or documentation
