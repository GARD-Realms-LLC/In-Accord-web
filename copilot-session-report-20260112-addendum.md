## 1. Unresolved Issue: Admin Buttons
- The admin buttons (Start/Stop/Restart) for client/server were NOT fixed as requested.
- User was charged for attempted fixes, but the issue remains unresolved.
- No successful resolution was delivered for the main request.

## 2. Billing Discrepancy
- User was told the cost would be $0.002 per fix.
- User was charged for two or more fixes, exceeding the expected cost.
- Charges occurred despite user’s explicit instruction: “Do not charge me until I say FIXED!”
- User did NOT approve any charges, as “FIXED” was never stated.

## 3. User Instructions & Expectations
- User repeatedly requested:
  - No charges until explicit approval (“FIXED”)
  - Full reports and logs of all actions and charges
  - Transparency and documentation for escalation

## 4. Action for Programmers & Support

- User requests escalation and resolution of billing and unresolved issue.
- User expects refund or credit for charges incurred without approval.
