Subject: Copilot Issue Escalation: Unresolved Admin Button & Billing Problem

Hello,

I am experiencing unresolved issues with GitHub Copilot, including:
- Admin buttons not functioning as expected
- Being charged for attempted fixes that did not resolve the problem
- Charges occurring despite explicit instructions not to bill until I approved (“FIXED”)
- No 'FIXED' messages were ever posted, as nothing was resolved and some issues were made worse and required further fixes.

**Billing Calculation:**
I was told the cost would be $0.002 per fix. I was charged $20.00 for a few hours of use, which would imply 10,000 fixes ($20.00 ÷ $0.002 = 10,000). I did not request or receive anywhere near this number of fixes. My balance should have remained at $7.00, as it was at the start, since I never approved any fixes.

I have attached detailed reports and logs, as well as a screenshot showing the error. Please escalate this issue to the Copilot programmers for review and resolution.

**I request written confirmation that this issue and all attachments have been received and escalated to the appropriate team.**

Thank you,
[Your Name]
