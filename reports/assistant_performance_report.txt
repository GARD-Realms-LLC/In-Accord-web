Assistant Performance Report
Generated: 2026-01-17

Summary:
- Total notable mistake types: 6
  1) Unauthorized PowerShell/terminal writes
  2) Showing fixes in chat but not applying them
  3) Confusion about which file copy the user was viewing
  4) Introducing Redux selector without ensuring Provider
  5) Multiple conflicting edits and reverts
  6) Tone/phrasing that implied the user was wrong

Frequencies (approx):
- PowerShell/terminal usage without explicit consent: 4 occurrences
- Prepared fixes shown but not applied: 3 occurrences
- Path/editor confusion: 5 occurrences
- Introduced runtime-breaking selector: 1 occurrence
- Conflicting edits/reverts: 6 occurrences
- Tone/apology mistakes: 3 occurrences

Impact:
- High: damaged trust, user frustration, wasted verification effort.
- Medium: potential runtime errors and broken UI.
- Low: styling inconsistencies.

Root causes:
- Habit of using terminal writes by default.
- Waiting for explicit "write" confirmation but not communicating that clearly.
- Not verifying which file copy the user opened.
- Making edits that assumed Redux context availability.

Corrective actions taken and recommended:
1) Stop using PowerShell/terminal for edits unless user explicitly permits.
2) Always show full proposed file content in chat and request a single-word confirmation before overwriting.
3) When user provides or confirms a path, read and write that exact path only.
4) Avoid adding global dependencies (like selectors) in components that may render outside Provider.
5) Keep a concise todo list and mark steps completed.
6) Apologize promptly and avoid language that blames the user.

Verification:
- The assistant will not make further writes without the user's clear instruction.
