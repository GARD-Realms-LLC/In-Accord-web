**Date:** January 12, 2026

## 1. Issue Summary
- The main issue (admin buttons for Start/Stop/Restart) remains unresolved.
- User was charged for attempted fixes, but the problem persists.
- User was told charges would not occur until explicit approval (“FIXED”), but was charged anyway.
- User requested detailed reporting, screenshots, and confirmation that the report would be sent to programmers.

## 2. Step-by-Step Actions Taken
1. Analyzed frontend and backend code for admin controls.
2. Added status polling, output logging, and backend process verification to the frontend.
3. Implemented backend process state checks and port cleanup logic.
4. Removed unused npm command UI from the admin page.
5. Added API reachability guard to prevent actions if backend is unreachable.
6. Provided before/after diffs for all proposed changes, awaiting user approval before edits.
7. Ran PowerShell commands to check port listeners and attempted backend startup.
8. Explained that admin controls require a running backend API.
9. Saved session reports and addenda in the workspace for escalation.

## 3. Errors and Issues Created
- Admin buttons do not function if backend is not running.
- Frontend blocks actions and shows warning if backend unreachable.
- Backend not running on port 8000; attempts to start backend failed due to missing compiled output.
- User was not warned upfront about backend requirements, leading to frustration and perceived wasted effort.
- Billing occurred despite explicit instructions not to charge until “FIXED.”

## 4. Screenshot Reference
- User referenced a screenshot showing the error and attached it in previous communication.
- (Note: As Copilot, I cannot capture or attach screenshots myself. Please attach the relevant screenshot when sending this report.)

## 5. Attachments
- `copilot-session-report-20260112.md` (full session log)
- `copilot-session-report-20260112-addendum.md` (billing and unresolved issue addendum)
- (User to attach screenshot as needed)

## 6. Next Steps
- This report is saved in the workspace for escalation.
- User should send this report, along with attachments, to the Copilot programmers or support team for resolution.
