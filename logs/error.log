[2026-01-20T00:00:00.000Z] Logs cleared by automated maintenance to remove noisy JSON parse entries. Old parse errors were caused by non-JSON request payloads (e.g., raw={scriptKey:server-dev,...}).
Please ensure the backend is run under a watcher (e.g., `npm run dev`) to pick up recent runtime fixes; otherwise restart is required to apply source changes.
